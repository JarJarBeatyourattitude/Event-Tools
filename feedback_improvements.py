This is here so that when users get a notification, (and hopefully act on it) they can rate the nofitication by different metrics to 
help improve the AI 

When a user clicks to provide feedback, the first popup should ask for a general rating, in case the manager doesn't have the time 
to invest. However, there should be a "show more" or simiar option that allows the user to rate all of (or any individually) of the 
metrics taken into account by the model. 

If I have a default wizard for the initial setup, maybe that can be optimized too by making it an AI and feeding it the data of what settings
were chosen in the end given few questions answers and # of followers (or something like that)
