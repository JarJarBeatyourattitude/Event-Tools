'''I'm going to do something absolutely awesome here, I'm going to let a client create their custom filter automatically
#This will be done with some way to find examples more easily than pasting text directly. 

I can start with adding a news api, though it might be weird that the end product doesn't scan newspapers (yet)
 
 Maybe if my tool does a one time scan, there can be a database of all past follower tweets, so that a client can 
scan through them with screeners that let them do things like look for the tweets that did the best vs expected.
