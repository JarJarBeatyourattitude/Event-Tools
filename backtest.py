Maybe if my tool does a one time scan, there can be a database of all past follower tweets, so that a client can 
scan through them with screeners that let them do things like look for the tweets that did the best vs expected.
there can be a "notification test" where sample follower notifications of what would have been showed can be 
displayed. I think it's super cool. 

Cost of past tweets (scraping) is around $0.40 per 1 thousand followers at around 2 posts/comments each 
That could be just $4 for a 10k follower business! Pretty reasonable.
Not good with a free trial however, as that is way more cost up front. 
If I can keep companies for a 1.5 years on average with $10 profit per month, that's $180 total. In that case,
it could be worth putting down $50 to get 24 post history for 10k followers, 2 post history for 100k followers, etc.

The backtest should also let the clent rate each tweet by different metrics (see feedback_improvement). This is different from 
diy_topic, since that has more general options to start, while this lets users give feedback on more specifid alerts.
